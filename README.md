# Happy Holidays
[[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/happy-holidays/)]

**Happy Holidays** is a Minecraft mod that adds holidays to Minecraft.

This mod aims to incorporate various real-life holidays into the game, with interesting mechanics and goals for users to work towards while playing the game. It aims to enhance the Minecraft experience by not only adding holiday-themed blocks, items and mobs to the game, but also in introducing interesting and new mechanics that fit the vanilla Minecraft experience!

## Building the Project
Cloning this repository and opening the build.gradle in IntelliJ should automatically set up the development environment. To run the application, just use the normal build scripts provided by Forge. For data generation, you will need to set `GeckoModLib.DISALBE_IN_DEV` inside the HappyHolidaysMod class to `true`; only then will the data generation run. This is a workaround for now, hopefully I'll get around to figuring out the issue with this.
