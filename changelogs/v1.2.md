- Bauble recipes now give 4 Baubles instead of 2
- Big Bauble recipes now give 4 Baubles instead of 2
- Christmas Light recipes now give 4 Lights instead of 2

## Christmas Lights and Tinsels

In this update, Christmas Lights and Tinsel have had their behaviour changed to imitate how Glow Lichen in vanilla Minecraft would work. This will most likely cause your existing decorations to look kind of funky, but breaking and replacing them should fix the issue!

- Changed Christmas Lights and Tinsel to work similarly to how Glow Lichen works (i.e. each surface can be pressed to add a new Light / Tinsel)

## Bell Ornaments

Added Bell Ornaments! These are a new type of basic ornament that work similarly to baubles and big baubles.

- Can be crafted using String, Iron Ingots and Christmas Dyes
- They are considered basic ornaments, and will be placeable inside the Christmas Star
- The bells have also been added to loot tables where basic ornaments would drop
- Right-clicking the bells will produce a short bell sound

## Alphabet Ornaments

Added Alphabet Ornaments! These are glass-based, basic ornaments that cover the standard English alphabet

- Alphabet Ornament Templates can be crafted from a glass block inside a stonecutter (1 glass gives 8 templates)
- Each template can be crafted further in the stonecutter to obtain the corresponding letter (1 template gives 1 alphabet ornament)
- Christmas Dye can be applied to the ornaments to dye them that respective colour
    - Using the dye on the ornaments will not consume the dye

## Head Ornaments

More head ornaments have been added! These are rare ornaments that can only be obtained from Christmas sources (i.e. vanilla mobs will not drop these).

- Added both Passive mob heads (Pig, Cow, Sheep, Chicken) and Hostile mob head ornaments (Blaze, Phantom, Drowned, Ghast)
- Obtained purely as Rare Ornaments from Christmas sources (i.e. mobs *do not* drop them)

# Decorations

This update also includes more decorations for players to use when decorating their Christmas tree / environment!

- Frost — ice-based decoration that gives a frosted effect when placed on glass blocks
    - Crafted using Ice, similar to how Glass Panes are crafted
    - Works similar to Glow Lichen, can be placed on adjacent walls

# Snow Globe

The Snow Globe is a new legendary item that allows the player to change weather to rainy / snowy when used!

- Obtained as a legendary drop from Presents (chance of dropping increases from Baby to Adult to Elder)
- Snow Globes from Presents have zero charges and must be charged up before they can be used
- Charging Snow Globes — this can be done by using the Snow Globe on a full cauldron of Powder Snow
    - Doing so will empty the cauldron and increase the charges of the Snow Globe by 1
    - Each Snow Globe has a maximum of 5 charges
- Using Snow Globes — the Snow Globe will intensify the current weather state
    - If the weather is clear, using the Snow Globe will turn the weather into rainy / snowy and consume 1 charge
    - If the weather is rainy (no thunder), using the Snow Globe will turn the weather into a thunderstorm / blizzard and consume 1 charge
    - If the weather is thunderstorming, then the Snow Globe will not consume any charges

# Gingerbread

Gingerbread Blocks have gotten some tweaks and additions!

- Each type of Gingerbread Block now has different strength levels, where Soggy blocks are very weak and cooked Gingerbread Blocks are stronger
- Added the Gingerbread Bricks and Gingerbread Tiles (with dough, cooked and soggy variations)
    - Their respective crafting recipes are also available when you pick up the base block
    - The stonecutter also works with these blocks

    - Any Gingerbread / Gingerbread Dough blocks (including stairs, slabs and walls) will turn soggy when it comes into contact with water
    - Added sound and particle effects when Gingerbread Blocks are turned soggy
    - Improved logic for the conditions in which Gingerbread Dough Blocks and Gingerbread Blocks would turn soggy

# Candy Cane

Candy Canes have gotten an upgrade as well!

- Block mechanics have been improved (these were updated in 1.1.2, but included here are the changes again)
    - Acts similarly to glowstone, where mining with a normal pickaxe will give only some of the corresponding candy cane
    - Mining with Fortune will give more candy canes
    - Mining with Silk Touch will give the block itself
    - Exploding mechanic — previously introduced in 1.1, this feature has been improved!
        - Explosives do not reduce the number of drops of the Candy Cane; instead, it will drop all the Candy Cane
        - Exploding the Candy Cane Blocks also give higher chances for its ornament to drop
        - The frequency at which the ornament drops is increased further if the block was destroyed by a natural explosion
- Added Candy Cane Bricks and Tiles (Festive versions as well), along with stairs / slab / wall types for each of the Candy Cane blocks!
- Improved logic for determining festive shape (green-red or red-green) during placement —
    - Previously, this depended on the blocks currently around them
    - Now, the change has been made so that the system is more deterministic, i.e. when you place a festive block at one spot, replacing it will always give the same festive shape

# Stockings

You can now upgrade your Stockings to Enchanted Stockings, where rarer drops (and multiple drops) can be obtained!

- Use an Enchanted Thread on the Stocking to upgrade it to its enchanted state
    - Enchanted Threads can be obtained from all Christmas sources as a rare item
- Enchanted Stockings have the same drops as normal Stockings
    - Enchanted Stockings will drop a larger stack of items for each item (normal stockings drop only 1 item)
    - Enchanted Stockings also have additional, rarer drops added to their drop tables
    - Rarer items are also more likely to drop as compared to normal Stockings
- Enchanted Stockings are subjected to the same effects as Stockings (e.g. affected by presence of Milk and Cookies, chance of filling at night remains the same)
- Enchanted Threads can be cut from the Enchanted Stocking by right-clicking with Shears
- Breaking an Enchanted Stocking with Shears will give you the respective Stocking as well as the Enchanted Thread
    - Breaking *without* Shears will only give you the Stocking, so be careful!

# Music Box

The Music Box has been upgraded — it now contains a bunch of storage for your Music Sheets, and has controls to make it automatically play the music you want!

- Added an inventory to the Music Box —
    - The Music Box has 27 slots available for you to store Sheet Music
    - The Music Box can only take in Sheet Music

    - When the Music Box is played, it will play the Sheet Music in the order in which it is placed in the Music Box (left to right)
    - The Music Box will not take into account the size of the stack of Sheet Music you've put in (e.g. 16 pieces of Sheet Music won't make it play 16 times, it'll just play it once)
    - The user interface of the Music Box allows you to play, stop, jump to the previous / next track and set it to loop if you wish!
- Increased the range of the Music Box to match the Jukebox

# Mob Changes

## Angry Santa

    - Ornaments are selected at random, and the elf has a limit as to how many he will buy
    - The number of emeralds you receive per ornament depends on the tier of ornament that is sold to the Elf
- Emerald following — Santa's Elf will attempt to pick up any emeralds on the ground in the area around him

    - Added a delay before he picks up a request item thrown to him
- Rebalanced the items sold by Santa's Elf —
    - Santa's Elf now will sell unique basic ornaments and rare ornaments
    - Santa's Elf has reduced the price for some items

## Grinch

- Grinch will now accept *empty* Gifts (this is mainly for creative uses, you can't obtain a Gift without an item in survival)
- Improved appeasement logic for the Grinch — he now will move onto the dropped Wrapped Gift and wait a bit before picking it up

# Technical Changes

- Implemented data generation for most of the content of the mod (i.e. blockstates, item models, advancements, loot tables, tags etc.), should considerably speed up future development time
    - These can be found under `data` package
    - Note: there is some incompatibility with GeckoLib, so to run the datagen you need to set "DISABLE_IN_DEV" to `true` under `HappyHolidaysMod` class before running the generator
- Improved the structure of the project
    - Removed Ornament classes and instead replaced it with reusable Decoration classes
    - Removed `ChristmasBlock` class and added an interface to be used instead (i.e. `ChristmasLike` **and `ChristmasBlock` interfaces)

# Bugs and Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the inventory inside the Christmas Star interface would show "Christmas Star" instead of "Inventory", Gift Wrapper interface would show "Gift Wrapper" instead of "Inventory"
- Fixed a bug where Santa's Elf wouldn't pick up a request item if there was already one on the ground
- Fixed a bug where Santa's Elf was forgetting that there was a request in progress when the world is reloaded
