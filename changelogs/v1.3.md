This update is intended to be the last update for the Christmas portion of the mod, unless there are new, interesting features that I think of adding in the future. The main focus of this mod was not only new Christmas related content, but changing the internal systems to better support the addition of new holidays in the future. 

The holiday I’ll be working on after this update is Chinese New Year, which will hopefully come out before next year’s Chinese New Year... well then, enjoy the update!

    - Nutcracker inventories can hold Special Walnuts (more on this later), as well as armour items
    - This inventory can be accessed once you have successfully tamed the Nutcracker by right-clicking them
    - Nutcracker ammunition is selected first from the inventory; if not, the Nutcracker fires plain Walnuts at enemies
    - Ammunition chosen from the inventory follows the order of left-first
    - Armour bonuses from equipment do not include bonuses from enchantments

    - Each Nutcracker comes with a set of empty Patrol Orders that can be retrieved by right-clicking them with a Swagger Stick
    - When a Nutcracker has a Patrol Orders in their inventory, they will patrol along the route that was indicated on that Patrol Orders
        - Holding a Patrol Orders will show the patrol area of the Nutcracker, with a small light that travels along the route the Nutcracker will follow
        - Determining patrol routes — each Patrol Orders has a patrol route attached to it that can be determined by the player
            - Right-clicking spots on the ground will indicate the points to which the Nutcracker will attempt to patrol
            - A route is considered complete when the final point is set as the same point — the Patrol Order is locked from further edits after this
            - Actions taken by the player in setting various points on the route are reflected in the game’s chat
    - Right-clicking a Nutcracker that has a Patrol Orders using a Swagger Stick will remove that Patrol Orders from their inventory, and also stop them from patrolling

    - Swagger Sticks can be obtained as a Legendary item from presents

# Holiday Intervals and Availability

Availabilty and Intervals are a set of new features in Happy Holidays that aims to provide more customisability over the content of the mod. Don’t like having Grinches spawning around your presents? Want to make Christmas only last during December? Then this new feature is just for you!

- Availability and Intervals work together to determine what content of the mod should be disabled, and can be controlled through the use of commands!
- If you’re not sure of how they work, you can try playing around with the commands; the settings can easily be reset to default!
- If you’re not sure of how this works, it’s fine! This won’t affect your gameplay of the mod in any way from previous times; it’s mainly for those who want to tweak some features of the mod to improve their own gameplay experience.

## Intervals

Intervals determine the “active” period of the holiday: this means that between the two dates provided, the content of that holiday will be active and working. However, once this interval has been passed, some content of the mod will be dis`abled.

- The default interval set for all holidays is `all_year`, meaning that all holidays will be active throughout the entire year
- Players (with admin privileges / access to cheats) are able to tweak this by either using some presets, or defining their own intervals
    - Example: using a preset: `/happyholidays christmas interval preset [all_year | seasonal]`
    - Example: setting a specific interval: `/happyholidays christmas interval set MM-DD MM-DD`
- Intervals are world-specific — they only affect the world that the changes have been made on

## Availability

To further enhance customisability, we have Availability, which determines what content will be enabled or disabled! Availability determines whether a specific part of that holiday will be working, and this depends on the setting that has been applied to it.

- The default availability set for all content is `INTERVAL_ONLY`, meaning that the content will only be active during the specified interval for that holiday.
- Once again, players with admin privileges can change the availability:
    - Example: disabling the spawning of the Grinch *entirely*: `/happyholidays christmas availability set canGrinchSpawn NEVER`
    - Example: enabling the Christmas buffs to be always on (regardless of whether you’re in the interval specified for Christmas): `/happyholidays christmas availability set canStarGiveBuff ALWAYS`
- Availability is also world-specific
