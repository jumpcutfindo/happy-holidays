This is a minor update to Happy Holidays: it improves a few gameplay behaviours and functionalities, as well as fixes some bugs.

# Gameplay Changes

- Improved Grinch spawning logic and behaviour
    - Reduced Grinch spawn rate — previously, a new Grinch would spawn almost immediately after the previous one was appeased
    - Reduced amount of Grinch drops
    - Fixed a bug where the Grinch was able to break presents from outside walls / fences
- Improved Gingerbread Men behaviour
    - Fixed a bug where the Gingerbread Men were getting stuck under 2 block tall ceilings (reduced their height slightly)
    - Fixed a bug where the Gingerbread Men would be confused as to whether to follow the player or their leader
- Improve model animation —
    - Grinch and Santa's Elf will now look around instead of having their heads stuck in place
- Candy Cane —
    - Increased the number of Candy Cane blocks obtained from crafting from 2 to 4
    - Fixed a bug where the Candy Cane blocks were dropping their items instead of the blocks themselves when mined with Silk Touch
- Christmas Guide
    - Improved guide to provide more details on the functionality of different parts of the mod — previously it was too vague
- Drops and rewards tweaks —
    - Added Copper Ingot to most loot tables
    - Reduced the probability of obtaining sheet music from all sources — the drops were too common
    - Rebalanced the drop rates of presents — baby presents will tend to give more ornaments while elder presents will tend to give more functional goodies
- Removed Head Ornament crafting recipes —
    - Standardised it so that all head-based ornaments are only obtainable from Christmas sources

# Technical Changes

- Change ChristmasRarity setting — is now an overridable function implemented in the interface
- Fix texture mipmap issues — mipmap levels were being limit to 3 instead of 4 because of the resolution of some Christmas textures
