This is the initial release of Happy Holidays! The base edition of the mod adds **Christmas** to Minecraft. Due to the substantial number of things added (i.e. everything in Christmas so far), please refer to the wiki for the relevant content.

If you encounter any bugs or issues with this version, please don't hesitate to create an issue so that I can work on it! Thanks for playing!
