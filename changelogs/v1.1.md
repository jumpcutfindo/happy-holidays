This major update to the Happy Holidays mod enables it to work on **Minecraft 1.17.1**. It also adds a few new mechanics and features, as well as general code clean up.

If you spot any bugs or problems with the mod while playing, please do leave a bug report under issues of this repository! Thanks and enjoy!

# General
- Updated Happy Holidays to Minecraft 1.17.1
- Updated rewards and requests to accomodate new items added to Minecraft 1.17

# Gingerbread Men
- Adjusted Gingerbread Men's spawn rate to be more in tune with other passive mobs
- Gingerbread Men will run away from the player only if they are holding a bucket full of water
- Soggy Gingerbread Men will move towards the player only if they are holding a block that is heat emitting
    - This list of blocks includes the blocks in the list below (lava → bucket of lava), *excluding* furnaces and smokers
    - Better defined the list of "heat-emitting" blocks that Gingerbread Men respond to. Soggy Gingerbread Men will convert to Gingerbread Men if next to:
        - Lit furnace / blast furnace / smoker
        - Fire / soul fire
        - Campfire / soul campfire
        - Magma block
        - Lava
- Adjusted the radius in which a heat emitting block can be placed to heat up Soggy Gingerbread Men
    - Used to be directly adjacent, now it's just any block around the Soggy Gingerbread Man
  
# Candy Cane
- Candy Cane blocks are now a bit more crumbly than before — they like being blown up!
    - Candy Cane blocks have a higher tendency to drop Enchanted Candy Canes when they have been blown up, as compared to being mined
    - The chances are even higher if the source of the explosion is natural (i.e. creepers, ghasts)
- Candy Cane blocks no longer always drop 4 candy canes when under the influence of a Christmas Star
- When Candy Cane blocks are exploded, the amount of Candy Canes dropped each time will be the same as when a player mines the block (i.e. unaffected by explosion decay)

# Grinch
- Adjusted Grinch appeasement drop rates
    - Number of items of a stack dropped by the Grinch on appeasement have been substantially reduced
- Fixed a bug where Grinches would spawn inside blocks and suffocate

# Santa's Elf
- Rebalanced Toy Part Requests to be less demanding
    - Removed a few items from the highest tier of items to be obtained to make it more reasonable

# Santa
- Rebalanced Santa's Gifts — rewards are now split more evenly across the different tiers and the amounts of items received has been adjusted

# Miscellaneous
- Christmas Star will now spawn golden particles around it when the bonus tier is active
- Santa and Grinch mobs no longer drop items when killed using `/kill`
- Improved system for searching of Christmas Star by blocks and entities when considering it for its effects
